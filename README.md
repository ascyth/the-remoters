Data Spec:

--
A complete data spec describing your collected data. This can be in the form of a README/simple text file, but it should describe the full data format, including assumptions about data types, assumptions about keys and cross-references, whether fields are "required" or optional, etc. For at least 8 of the attributes of your records, you should provide the following information:
Type of data that will be used for the representation.
Default value
Range of value.
Simplified analysis of the distribution of values
Are these values unique?
Will you use this value (maybe in composition with others) to detect possible duplicate records? If so, how?
Is this a required value?
Do you plan to use this attribute/feature in the analysis? If so, how?
Does this feature include potentially sensitive information? If so, how do you suggest handling such issues?
