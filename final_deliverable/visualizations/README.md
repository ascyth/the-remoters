# Visualizations
## Yearly Sentiment Bar Graph
- Why did you pick this representation?
It ultimately came down to a bar graph or a line graph.  This representation lent itself nicely to the few x values of this plot.  Since there are only 4 years in question, a line graph felt like overkill; the progression from year to year is easy to see in the bars, and the values are easier to compare among sources.  Further, the linear interpolation would have been pronounced in a line graph.  These being yearly means, the histogram representation conveys only the information that we know without suggesting intermediate values that are not accurate or germane.
- What alternative ways might you communicate the result?
This could hypothetically have also been a line graph, but was not for the reasons mentioned.  I could have used a scatter plot, but it seemed that would have made the specific values unclear.  The data is also too sparse for a scatter plot.  I could have used a box plot to convey some more statistical information about the yearly sentiments, but this would have become a bit too dense when comparing the multiple sources each year.
- Were there any challenges visualizing the results, if so, what where they?
The biggest challenge was deciding how to best compare the sentiments from various sources, making both change over time and internal difference clear.  This pushed me away from using a line for this representation and towards a staggered histogram, which keeps the information neat and legible.
- Will your visualization require text to provide context or is it standalone (either is fine, but it’s recognized which type your visualization is)?
With knowledge of what we did for the project, it is standalone.
